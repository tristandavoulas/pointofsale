# Pete's Restaurant and Brewhouse Point-of-Sale UI

This project is a reimagining of the gorgeous (/s) OneTouch POS System used by restaurants across the country. Plenty of my fellow employees thought that their UI 
could use with some modernization, so that is what I'm setting out to achieve with this project. This projects purely consists of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
